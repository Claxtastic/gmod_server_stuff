			"As an admin, there is a UI which can be used to control TTT variables. Sometimes things are a little hard to find, but it is convenient. Open it by pressing M"
			"Once the UI is open, you'll see the CMDS tab:"
			"One useful thing in cmds is mapvote, another is under the TTT Admin dropdown, you can force or unforce a player to spectate with fspec."
			"The other useful tab is the TTT tab:"
			"The most useful section here is \"Gameplay\", where you can set the percentage of traitor players with ttt_traitor_pct, and the same for detectives. Expand \"Other gameplay settings\" and you can change the minimum players needed for the round to start with ttt_minimum_players"
			"Lastly, the Maps tab:"
			"Here you can simply force the server to another map. The list shows all available maps on the server, and a Gamemode dropdown box to select the gamemode you want for the chosen map."
			"COMMANDS:"
