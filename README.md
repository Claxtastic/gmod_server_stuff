What is this?
=============

All files found here are simply the Lua scripts that define characteristics of weapons in the game [Garry's Mod](https://gmod.facepunch.com/) for [Trouble in Terrorist Town](http://ttt.badking.net/) gamemode.

I made these changes just to try and balance some of the weapons for use on my private GMOD server.

All weapons in the "addons" directory of this repo were first found in [Fuzzik's "TTT Weapon Collection"](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=194965598).
All other weapons are weapons found in the vanilla TTT gamemode.
